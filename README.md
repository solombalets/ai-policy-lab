Welcome to my personal lab at the intersection of political analysis and artificial intelligence.

This repository documents my transition from international affairs to the application of AI for political modeling, discourse analysis, and hybrid conflict research.

## üß≠ Project: Narratives of Identity and Loyalty ‚Äî NLP-Based Discourse Analysis of Russian Psychological Warfare

This project explores how Russian pro-government Telegram channels manipulate concepts of identity, loyalty, and belonging through targeted narratives. In the aftermath of political repressions and mass emigration, the regime‚Äôs information ecosystem has increasingly weaponized cultural disorientation and national mythmaking to delegitimize dissent and reinforce authoritarian loyalty.

Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project analyzes rhetorical strategies aimed at:

- Redefining "Russianness" to exclude political opponents and exiles.
- Appropriating anti-elitist and nationalist rhetoric while defending a deeply entrenched imperial establishment.
- Gaslighting dissenters through pejorative labeling (e.g., "transukrainians") to delegitimize their claims to Russian identity.
- Creating ideological ambiguity by conflating ethnic, civic, and imperial definitions of nationhood to suppress coherent opposition narratives.

Through this analysis, the project seeks to reveal the internal contradictions of pro-regime discourse, the methods of psychological warfare targeting emigrant communities, and the broader role of narrative control in hybrid authoritarianism.

### Key Research Questions

- How is national identity reconstructed in pro-government narratives under conditions of political crisis?
- What linguistic patterns signal psychological warfare tactics against dissenting or exiled Russians?
- How do contradictions between imperial, nationalist, and anti-elitist rhetoric manifest linguistically?
- Can discourse analysis expose the regime's vulnerabilities in sustaining its legitimacy narrative?

### Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK, HuggingFace Transformers, sklearn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

### Data Sources

- Posts from selected Russian pro-government Telegram channels (to be collected and analyzed)
- Supplementary political speeches, state media publications, and official statements where relevant

### Future Directions

- Mapping discursive clusters and contradictions across different ideological factions
- Comparative analysis with independent and opposition media narratives
- Development of a typology for psychological manipulation techniques in authoritarian digital propaganda
- Application of time-series analysis to trace narrative evolution during political crises

## üéØ Goals

- Master and apply AI tools (LLMs, NLP, data modeling) to real-world political and strategic challenges
- Build substantive projects demonstrating the use of AI in international relations, hybrid conflict research, and discourse analysis
- Establish a portfolio to support career transition toward tech-policy, strategic analysis, or AI-assisted political research
