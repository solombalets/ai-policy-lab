# 🧠 AI + Political Analysis Lab

Welcome to my personal lab at the intersection of political analysis and artificial intelligence.

This repository documents my transition from international affairs to the application of AI for political modeling, discourse analysis, and hybrid conflict research.

## 🧭 Project: NLP Analysis of Political Rhetoric

A focused exploration into the linguistic patterns and rhetorical strategies employed by political actors, using natural language processing tools.

### Key Research Questions

- What linguistic markers distinguish militarized or aggressive political rhetoric?
- How do rhetorical strategies vary across countries, political systems, or actor types?
- Can we model the potential escalation of conflict based on discursive shifts?

### Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK, HuggingFace Transformers, sklearn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

### Data Sources (to be expanded)

- Speeches from the UN, world leaders, and parliaments
- Political news articles and official statements

### Future Directions

- Dashboard for rhetorical evolution
- Time-series and geographical mapping
- Classification model training for rhetorical types

## 🎯 Goals

- Learn and apply AI tools (LLMs, NLP, data modeling) to real-world political problems
- Build projects demonstrating the use of AI in international relations, strategy, and public discourse
- Create a portfolio to support career transition to tech-policy or AI-driven strategic analysis
