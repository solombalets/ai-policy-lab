# AI + Political Analysis Lab

Welcome to my personal lab at the intersection of political analysis and artificial intelligence.

This repository documents my transition from international affairs to the application of AI for political modeling, discourse analysis, and hybrid conflict research.

## Goals

- Learn and apply AI tools (LLMs, NLP, data modeling) to real-world political problems
- Build projects demonstrating the use of AI in international relations, strategy, and public discourse
- Create a portfolio to support career transition to tech-policy or AI-driven strategic analysis
